This problem affects millions of women and girls worldwide, especially those living in low-income communities and marginalized populations. Due to financial challenges, many individuals struggle to afford or access items like sanitary pads, tampons, or menstrual cups, which are crucial for managing menstruation hygienically. As a result, some resort to unhygienic and unsafe practices during their periods, which can be harmful to their health and well-being.")
